~~Afternoon-ish~~

Aesthetic
- A rustic somber platformer for challenge and exploration

Solidified win and lose states and game objects for the game
- Reach the bottom most part of the tilemap to win
- Player is a haunted fighting dummy
- Avoiding flying projectiles, attacking scarecrows, and falling spikeballs

Found assets to use
Made tile map
Added desired prefabs and props to the tile map

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

~~Night~~

Changed premise
- I feel unsure if I can do the "exploratory" aesthetic
- Might require a better tilemap and long enough playtime for things to getting genuinely exploratory
- All the assets are background sprites so if I want to make animations, I wouldn't be able to use pre-existing materials
- All just won't fit timeframe

New Aesthetic
- A light-hearted Adventure Platformer for challenge and escapism

Goals
- Add a few tricks to the tile map to mislead them into more dangerous paths
- Choose assets that are cutesy and appealing
- The rules don't require much brainpower

Core Mechanics stay the same
- Move to end of platform, jump to new platform, move away from obstacles and enemies, dash at enemies to attack
- The mechanism are intuitive and recognizable for the escapism
- The tile map design is enough to establish a sense of challenge with the limited, small loop

Found new cutesy assets (light hearted!)
Found inspiration for a small quick tilemap
Started on tile map
Created player, enemy, coin, and spike props

---------------------------------------------------------------------

~~Afternoon~~

- Finished tile map, and added tilemap collider
- Added all desired enemies, coins, spikes, and flag onto the map
- Added player movement and jumping
- Added camera following the player
- Added the coin disappearing when touched by player
- Added text to display player score
- Coins add 100 points to score
- Added "you win" and "game over" panels to display when player wins or loses
- Added flags resulting a win panel
- Spikes touching a player results in a lose panel
- Added ESC as replay button when player wins or loses
- Added enemies moving back and forth on their platforms without falling

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday (11/14)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Found and added sound effects
- Prevent stuck state of falling off the tilemap eternally (you die now)
- Added dash attack
- Added destroying enemies and including that in the point score
- enemies touching a non-dashing player results in losing the game
- player and enemy sprites flip to face direction they are walking towards

PostMortem
---------------------------------------------------------------------
At the start, I was unsure about the idea I wanted to pursue. I wanted something
feasible given that I want had the weekend to work on this. I at first wanted to do
an exploratory rustic platformer but I realized that it would amp up the difficulty
in terms of making a good tile map and making the assets I found work in my favor.

I opted then to make a light-hearted platform that is more for killing time while
offering a moderate challenge. 

This meant that I was able to set more accomplishable goals like finding cutesy assets, 
setting good traps on my map, while having a familiar and natural set of rules anyone 
can pick up. I added "trap" coins where players have no choice but to die, and made them make 
a risky jump or two. 

I would argue that very few things went wrong aside from maybe amping up the difficulty
further since I would argue that this is currently tutorial-level hard. I also wished I had
more time to add some animations since static sprites stink.

In this project, I learned how to make tile maps, make the camera follow the player around,
use sprite maps, flip sprites through scripts, and setting up realistic goals based on tight schedules.
